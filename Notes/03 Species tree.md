Run the `identify` and `align` commands from gtdbtk. This will check the genomes against the single copy bac120 marker set.
Use the multiple sequence alignment from the align command into Iqtree2 to produce a species tree? 

*Note: The genome names need to be same as what the gene files contain for the reconciliation so need to use the renamed fna files from metaerg annotations.*
