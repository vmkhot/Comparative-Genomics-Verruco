Things to discuss
- verruco paper on-going
    - Where does my part end in this?
    - Currently making gene trees
- Cyano project
    - What documents are required for sending samples? 
    - Have you done this before?
    - What else can we do with this data?
    - Target date for submission

100% paralogs - single genome

okay that a lot of families that got kicked out as the in-group is larger - interested in families with a lot of members

is there a problem with over sampling multiple genomes? like the purple cluster?

Declare as "water samples for analysis"
- Do we need a letter for package?
- who is receiving, who is sending, what is happening with them? 
- Nothing about biological materials
    - "no pathogens"
No ice or dry ice necessary
