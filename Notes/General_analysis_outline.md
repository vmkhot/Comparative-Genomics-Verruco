# Workflow

This is a general workflow for ancestral reconstruction with links/tags to more detailed sections

1. **[[Genome_selection]]**  First we select the genomes to use and download from NCBI/collect. This includes checking completeness [[checkm2 results.xlsx]] and average nucleotide identity  [[fastani_results_filtered.txt]]
 #completeness #ani

2. **[[Annotation]]** Genomes here annotated using [MetaErg2](https://github.com/kinestetika/MetaErg)  
#metaerg #annotation

3.
